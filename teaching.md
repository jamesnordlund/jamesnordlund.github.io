## Current Courses

**Financial Modeling and Analytics Using Python**

Lecture notes for this course are currently being migrated over to my new teaching website [learning-fin.tech](https://learning-fin.tech).  The site also hosts documentation for the `ether_real_estate` package that I wrote for teaching blockchain technology via an investment simulation game (the package is available on PyPI).

Work related to this course has earned two university grants:
1.  A $21,000 grant to purchase a 64-core, 256GB RAM server for advanced instruction in computational finance
2.  A $50,000 grant to purchase interactive instructional hardware (e.g. smart whiteboards) for enhanced opportunities for student engagement

The faculty voted to require this course for all finance majors after one year of my teaching the course as an elective topic.
