## Working Papers

4. [Free to Distance?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3610397)<br/>
  (With Rajesh Narayanan, R. Kelley Pace, and Dimuthu Ratnadiwakara)
> Social distancing depends upon the prevalence of COVID-19 and the spread of COVID-19 depends upon social distancing. Therefore, social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 are simultaneously determined which complicates estimation. To avoid the issues of simultaneity and measurement error, we focus on reduced form modeling of social distancing as gauged by the change in the log of the proportion of individuals staying at home each week using cell phone tracking data. The reduced form involves a regression of the dependent variable as a function of county-level exogenous demographic variables (population density, age, education, race, and income) as well as jurisdictional fixed effects for 49 states. The evolving parameter estimates reflect stay at home choices by individuals (subject to their capacity to stay at home). Because of the spatial nature of a contagious disease, we also model the spillovers associated with demographic variables in surrounding counties as well as allow for disturbances that depend upon those in surrounding counties.

> Over the course of the data, the cross-sectional variation in social distance behavior increased over seven-fold from 0.0052 to 0.0375. The estimation results show that predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables explain substantially more variation (46.4%) of individual stay at home behavior than predictions from jurisdictional fixed effects (13.2%) with a low correlation between the jurisdictional and demographic predictive components (0.006). The predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables shows substantial spatial autoregressive dependence (lambda=0.847) which indicates that social distances will cluster. The increased variance of the behavior coupled with the high level of spatial dependence can result in relatively intense hotspots and coldspots of social distance which has implications for disease effects and mitigation.

3. [CEO Narcissism, Human Capital, and Firm Value](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3209882)<br/>
  (With Shane Johnson and Adam Kolasinski)
> Firms with narcissistic CEOs are more likely to experience the turnover of non-CEO executives; this effect is amplified for executives with pay closer to the CEO’s pay. Stock price reactions to narcissism-induced departures are more negative the longer the non-CEO executive’s tenure. If long-tenured non-CEO executives have more valuable human capital, the results imply a relation between CEO narcissism and the loss of valuable human capital. We find parallel results for mass layoffs of non-executive, rank-and-file employees. Our findings imply that CEO narcissism impacts firm value through its effect on the retention of valuable human capital.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> Louisiana State University, Texas A&M University

2. [Spillovers from Creditor Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2866505)
> I test for causal spillover effects of creditor control following loan covenant violation using a hierarchical matching estimator that is new to the finance literature. Other estimation approaches (e.g. regression discontinuity) explicitly assume away spillover effects, and produce biased estimates when spillovers are present. I find that firms increase debt issuance and investment in response to rival firm covenant violation, and that these firms experience an increase in sales growth. Because causal identification is limited to non-violating rival firms who were just as likely to violate a covenant, this effect is novel from the "deep-pocket" mechanism in the earlier literature.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> Louisiana State University, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney

1. [The Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risk](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077632)
> The SEC has expressed concern that some emerging risks -- most notably, cybersecurity risk -- exhibit an insufficient level and quality of disclosure.  Policymakers envision a board role in cybersecurity risk management, but whether that role would effectively improve risk disclosure is an open question.  This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment to investigate whether expertise at the board of directors affects cybersecurity risk disclosure.  I find that the level and quality of risk disclosure increases when the board has more knowledge about the risk.  Thus, board expertise contributes in the identification and disclosure of emerging risk.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> FMA 2018 Annual Meeting, Louisiana State University, Texas A&M University
