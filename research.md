## Working Papers

1. [The Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risk](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077632)<br/>
	R&R at *Journal of Accounting and Economics*
> Following a data breach, interlocking firms are more likely to disclose exposure to cybersecurity risk in their annual report.  Firms connected by auditors, via economic rivalry, or along a supply chain do not show similar disclosure propagation.  The evidence suggests that disclosure propagation over interlocking firms is driven by a director’s self-interests or by a behavioral response to cybersecurity risk saliency, rather than by an improved monitoring for risk exposure.  This finding sheds insight into the expanding length of risk factor disclosures and suggests that not all of this growth may be in the best interests of shareholders.<br/>

2. [CEO Narcissism, Human Capital, and Firm Value](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3209882)<br/>
  (with Shane Johnson and Adam Kolasinski)<br/>
  R&R at *Review of Finance*
> Firms with narcissistic CEOs are more likely to experience the turnover of non-CEO executives; this effect is amplified for executives with pay closer to the CEO’s pay. Stock price reactions to narcissism-induced departures are more negative the longer the non-CEO executive’s tenure. If long-tenured non-CEO executives have more valuable human capital, the results imply a relation between CEO narcissism and the loss of valuable human capital. We find parallel results for mass layoffs of non-executive, rank-and-file employees. Our findings imply that CEO narcissism impacts firm value through its effect on the retention of valuable human capital.<br/>

3. [Spillovers from Creditor Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2866505)
> A loan covenant violation may be informative to parties outside of the lender-firm pair that agreed to the covenant term.  This implies externalities of lender monitoring.  I find that a firm's covenant violation yields spillover effects both to other violators and to non-violators in the firm's industry.  Covenant violators have ex post renegotiation outcomes that depend upon rival firm violation.  This suggests that violation by peers informs the optimal renegotiation outcome following covenant violation.  Non-violators benefit competitively from peer violation.  Average spillover effects amount to between 8% to 60% of the direct effect, depending on the outcome studied.

4. Reputation and the Labor Market for Corporate Directors<br/>
	(with Shradha Bindal)
> Using a network regression framework that allows for joint determination of *all* possible appointments of directors to firms, we find that there is two-sided matching in board appointments.  A director is 14.5 times more likely to join a firm's board when the director and the firm share similar reputations for management friendliness.  Reputational matching between directors and firms is more important when coordination costs for rejecting mismatched directors are lower.  Directors are more likely to take on board appointments at firms where the appointment would shift the director's reputation towards her target reputation.  Moreover, consistent with theory, we find that a reputational shock to a subset of firms has economy-wide effects on the incentives for directors to change their reputations.
