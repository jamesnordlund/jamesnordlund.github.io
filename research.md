## Working Papers

3. CEO Narcissism, Human Capital, and Firm Value<br/>
  (With Shane Johnson and Adam Kolasinski)
> Using a text-based proxy for CEO narcissism, we find that firms with narcissistic CEOs are more likely to experience the turnover of other members of the top management team (TMT). This effect is amplified for TMT members with a pay level closer to that of CEO. Abnormal stock returns at announcements of such departures are positive for short-tenure TMT members, but are negative for long-tenure ones. If TMT members with longer tenure have more valuable human capital, the results suggest a relation between CEO narcissism and the loss of valuable human capital. We find parallel results for non-executive employee layoffs. The results imply important relations between CEO narcissism and the retention of a firmâ€™s valuable human capital.

2. [Spillovers from Creditor Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2866505)
> I test for causal spillover effects of creditor control following loan covenant violation using a hierarchical matching estimator that is new to the finance literature. Other estimation approaches (e.g. regression discontinuity) explicitly assume away spillover effects, and produce biased estimates when spillovers are present. I find that firms increase debt issuance and investment in response to rival firm covenant violation, and that these firms experience an increase in sales growth. Because causal identification is limited to non-violating rival firms who were just as likely to violate a covenant, this effect is novel from the "deep-pocket" mechanism in the earlier literature.

1. [Director Experience and Cybersecurity Events](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077632)
> We study changes to a director's reputation and monitoring activities following a data breach.  First, we find that directors face an increased hazard of turnover following a cybersecurity event, but that this is mitigated by supply-side considerations of finding a director's replacement.  Second, using a novel panel database of disclosed risk factors, we show that interlocked firms that retain the breach-affiliated director increase their incidence of cyber risk disclosure.  The propensity to be hacked is lower for these firms.  Our results shed light on the limits to reputation-based incentives and on a mechanism through which boards develop monitoring skill.
