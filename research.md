## Working Papers

3. [CEO Narcissism, Human Capital, and Firm Value](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3209882)<br/>
  (With Shane Johnson and Adam Kolasinski)
> Firms with narcissistic CEOs are more likely to experience the turnover of non-CEO executives; this effect is amplified for executives with pay closer to the CEO’s pay. Stock price reactions to narcissism-induced departures are more negative the longer the non-CEO executive’s tenure. If long-tenured non-CEO executives have more valuable human capital, the results imply a relation between CEO narcissism and the loss of valuable human capital. We find parallel results for mass layoffs of non-executive, rank-and-file employees. Our findings imply that CEO narcissism impacts firm value through its effect on the retention of valuable human capital.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> Louisiana State University, Texas A&M University

2. [Spillovers from Creditor Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2866505)
> I test for causal spillover effects of creditor control following loan covenant violation using a hierarchical matching estimator that is new to the finance literature. Other estimation approaches (e.g. regression discontinuity) explicitly assume away spillover effects, and produce biased estimates when spillovers are present. I find that firms increase debt issuance and investment in response to rival firm covenant violation, and that these firms experience an increase in sales growth. Because causal identification is limited to non-violating rival firms who were just as likely to violate a covenant, this effect is novel from the "deep-pocket" mechanism in the earlier literature.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> Louisiana State University, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney

1. [Director Experience and Cybersecurity Events](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077632)
> We study changes to a director's reputation and monitoring activities following a data breach.  First, we find that directors face an increased hazard of turnover following a cybersecurity event, but that this is mitigated by supply-side considerations of finding a director's replacement.  Second, using a novel panel database of disclosed risk factors, we show that interlocked firms that retain the breach-affiliated director increase their incidence of cyber risk disclosure.  The propensity to be hacked is lower for these firms.  Our results shed light on the limits to reputation-based incentives and on a mechanism through which boards develop monitoring skill.<br/><b>Presentations:</b> FMA 2018 Annual Meeting (scheduled), Texas A&M University
