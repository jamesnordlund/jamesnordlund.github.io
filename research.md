## Working Papers

1. [The Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risk](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077632)<br/>
	R&R at *Journal of Accounting and Economics*
> The SEC has expressed concern that some emerging risks -- most notably, cybersecurity risk -- exhibit an insufficient level and quality of disclosure.  Policymakers envision a board role in cybersecurity risk management, but whether that role would effectively improve risk disclosure is an open question.  This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment to investigate whether expertise at the board of directors affects cybersecurity risk disclosure.  I find that the level and quality of risk disclosure increases when the board has more knowledge about the risk.  Thus, board expertise contributes in the identification and disclosure of emerging risk.<br/>

2. [CEO Narcissism, Human Capital, and Firm Value](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3209882)<br/>
  (with Shane Johnson and Adam Kolasinski)<br/>
  R&R at *Review of Finance*
> Firms with narcissistic CEOs are more likely to experience the turnover of non-CEO executives; this effect is amplified for executives with pay closer to the CEO’s pay. Stock price reactions to narcissism-induced departures are more negative the longer the non-CEO executive’s tenure. If long-tenured non-CEO executives have more valuable human capital, the results imply a relation between CEO narcissism and the loss of valuable human capital. We find parallel results for mass layoffs of non-executive, rank-and-file employees. Our findings imply that CEO narcissism impacts firm value through its effect on the retention of valuable human capital.<br/>

3. [Spillovers from Creditor Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2866505)
> What externalities are generated by lender monitoring?  A loan covenant violation may be informative to parties outside of the lender-firm pair that agreed to the covenant term.  I find that a firm's covenant violation yields spillover effects both to other violators and to non-violators in the firm's industry.  Covenant violators have ex post renegotiation outcomes that depend upon rival firm violation.  This suggests that violation by peers informs the optimal renegotiation outcome following covenant violation.  Non-violators benefit competitively from peer violation.  Spillover effects amount to between 8% to 60% of the direct effect, depending on the outcome studied.

4. Reputation and the labor market for corporate directors<br/>
	(with Shradha Bindal)
> Using a network regression framework that allows for joint determination of <ins>all</ins> appointments of directors to firms, we find that there is two-sided matching in board appointments based on a director's and a firm's reputation for being management or shareholder friendly.  A director is 17 times more likely to join a firm's board when the director and the firm share similar reputations.  The likelihood of matching is stronger when coordination costs for rejecting mismatched directors are lower.  Moreover, consistent with theory, we find that a reputational shock to a subset of firms has economy-wide effects on the incentives for directors to change their reputations.  Finally, we find that presence of blockholders that have private information about the directors mitigate concerns about mismatch.
