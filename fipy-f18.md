## Financial Analytics - Fall 2018

This is a hands-on valuation course, suitable to masters students or advanced undergraduates.  The concepts follow the material covered in [Damodaran on Valuation](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Damodaran+on+Valuation%3A+Security+Analysis+for+Investment+and+Corporate+Finance%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471751212).  Students are expected to have taken previous classes in:

- Investments (FIN 3826)
- Financial Management (FIN 3716)
- Introductory Accounting (ACCT 2001)
- Introductory Microeconomics (ECON 2000)

where the course numberings reflect codings for undergraduate LSU courses.  These courses reflect the bare minimum amount of prerequisite knowledge, and students will benefit from having taken:

- Intermediate Accounting 1 and 2 (ACCT 3001, ACCT 3021)
- Statistics and Analytics for Business (ISDS 2000)

In contrast to the above accounting and finance prerequisites, no prior programming experience is required.

### The CoCalc Environment

This class applies financial concepts to real-world data using Python.  Both *computation* and *presentation* are emphasized skills in this class, and these two features are joined together in the phenomenal Jupyter notebook system.  Basically, a Jupyter notebook is a file that runs within your web browser and is capable of incorporating formatted text, live Python code, and beautifully rendered equations all within one document.  This class runs notebooks on [cocalc.com](cocalc.com), a teaching resource that simplifies distribution of course materials and collection of assignments.  Because computation is handled on a web server, there are no specific laptop requirements for the class.  However, students are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that they may code along with the lecture.
